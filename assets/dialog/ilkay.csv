Finally! I found the calculus class!
Hey! You three over there! What are you all up to? You're supposed to be in class!
Sorry but instead of attending class most people are learning calculus by watching 'Buders Bogaziciliden'. They really don't need your classes.
How dare you?! I will make sure they will fail the class!
