Are you working with them? This is madness! Students are acting like brainless zombies.
It was his idea... Ercan Korkut... We brainwashed the students with Yetmez Gencler videos.
And why did he need to do this exactly?
His ambition... He believed that MEF University was the most successful one at graduating competent students. He wanted all others to respect that belief...
His ambition blinded him!
He brainwashed everyone to make them believe it as well. So he get other to join MEF in the future without any hangups.
Brain washing people is not a solution to this! How can I end this madness?
He is on 5th floor. Defeat him... He is still giving Yetmez Gencler courses.
I have to go to the 5th floor immediately
Wait! You can't defeat him, you are still weak!
Do you know something?
Aye, according to the ancient legends, there is only one person who knows how to defeat him.
And who is that?
I'm telling you "ancient legends" right? There is a book of his learnings in the library. The book is guarded by someone who resides in the library. You need to be careful.
Is that "someone", our librarian? I knew the time would come someday. I shall pay a visit to library. Take care!
